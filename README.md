# wr-110

Web Rythm 110 is a beat box inspired by the canonical TR serie by Roland.

I used vanilla JavaScript, HTML and SASS.

WebPack brings ES6 modules, modular HTML and compiles Sass.

[Standardized audio context ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standardized-audio-context), by Chris Guttandin, brings uniformity across browsers regarding the Web Audio API.
